## ❓ Common Questions

### "Do I need Adobe Illustrator?"
**No!** The logo is already extracted and included as a PNG file.

### "Where should I host the logo?"
Your company website is best. Alternatively, use Cloudinary (free). See `LOGO-READY-TO-USE.md`.

### "Can I just use an image instead of HTML?"
You could, but you'd lose clickable links, text selection, and responsiveness. HTML is better.

### "Will this work in Gmail?"
Yes! The same HTML works in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and most email clients.

### "What if I don't have a mobile number?"
Just delete that line from the HTML template. Instructions in `CUSTOMIZATION-WORKSHEET.md`.

### "Can I change the colors?"
Yes, but we recommend keeping your brand colors. They're already applied correctly.
